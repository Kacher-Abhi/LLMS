- **Sales Simulation:** The number of products sold was simulated based on the inclusion of key persuasive phrases in the dialogues.
- **Compute Time Measurement:** The time taken to generate the dataset was recorded to assess the efficiency of data generation.
- **Dataset Format:** CSV format with columns for Salesman, User, TimeStamp, and Conversation.

## Usage
